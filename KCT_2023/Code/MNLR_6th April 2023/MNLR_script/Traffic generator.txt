I will check it out. Can you confirm the below instructions to run the traffic generator?

Syntax to run on sending node[there should be a results.pcap file on the receiving node]:

sudo python3 TrafficGeneratorMNLR.py -i [Destination of ipnode] -u ucast_test -c 50

Syntax to run on receiving node:

sudo python3 TrafficGeneratorMNLR.py -r ucast_test

Then,
sudo python3 TrafficGeneratorMNLR.py -a ucast_test
